Crypt::Blowfish
===============

Blowfish is a published algorithm written by Bruce Schneier
(http://www.counterpane.com/). Unlike IDEA or DES etc. there are no patent
implications in using this algorithm.

It uses anywhere between a 64 bit and a 144 bit key. The transform itself is
fast and operates on a 64 bit block, and most of the calculation time is in
initialising the context with the key data.

This implementation is entirely object oriented, and entirely written in Perl.
The perl form is (c) copyright Matthew Byng-Maddick <matthew@codix.net>, and
the actual structure and static data are copyright Bruce Schneier.

The licensing is GPL or Artistic at your preference.
